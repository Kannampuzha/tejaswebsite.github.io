 <h3>&rsaquo; About Me</h3>
 <p>I'm the instructor , and I love to teach. On top of that, I've spent a plenty good time out of my life writing code and I know how difficut it could be as a beginner to get started
  with any kind of programing language. This course is certianly for you if you think you cannot code because you don't understand any of it. The projects designed for this course
  are made keeping in mind the learning outcomes of the course, to make you able to write practical code. It is worth your time taking this course because you will actually learn to do it, not just look at the textbook and wonder how it works.
  When I am not coding, I am either sleeping or dreaming, or both. So if you are like me, welcome aboard ! Python is for lazy people !
 </p>
