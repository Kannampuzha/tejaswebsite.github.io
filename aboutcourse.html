 <h3>&rsaquo; About Course</h3>
 <p>TastyPython is originally designed for research intrested students looking for a good introduction to programming. However it is also well suitable for 
  young teens, especially the 12-16 year olds. You'll not learn it like a school-subject, because programming is not a school-subject. A project
  is assigned every week and towards the end of the course you'll be given a independent project of your own that will include everything that you learnt unitl now. The project can be few months long,
  and it is meant to be a testimonial for skill you learnt. A certificate is awarded on finishing the project and you'll have plenty of work to do after that.
  So hop along and join us for an exciting Python course.
